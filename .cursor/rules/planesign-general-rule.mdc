This project is designed to interface with an physical RGB LED matrix. This code itself is running on a Raspberry PI in a docker container.

The RGB LED matrix is 32 pixels high by 128 pixels wide. The primary way to interface with this RGB LED matrix is through the python bindings of the rpi-rgb-led-matrix library on GitHub.
